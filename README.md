# Arduino Stabilizer

### Background
This is a follow-up project based on the PHYS 159 lab of creating an ohmmeter using only resistors and a voltmeter.

### Project Goal
Build a device that will balance a small object on a rocking platform.

### Hardware 
- Arduino UNO
- Servo motor
- Sonar sensor
- LED's

### Design

The servo motor was used to keep the platform horizontal relative to the ground

The sonar sensor was used for orientation input to control the servo motor.
