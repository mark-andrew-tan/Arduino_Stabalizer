# Arduino Stabilizer

### Background
This is a follow-up project based on the PHYS 159 lab of creating an ohmmeter using only resistors and a voltmeter.

### Project Goal
Build a device that will balance a small object on a rocking platform.

### Hardware 
- Arduino UNO
- Servo motor
- Sonar sensor
- LED's

### Design

The servo motor was used to keep the platform horizontal relative to the ground, and the sonar sensor was used for orientation input to control the servo motor. LED's were used to indicate the degree of tilt relative to the ground.
